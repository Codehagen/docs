## Base URL

The Dingify API is built on REST principles.

All requests are made to the following base URL:

```bash
https://api.dingify.workers.dev
```

## Authentication

To authenticate your requests, you need to include your API key in the `header` as x-api-key.

```bash
x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY
```
## Response codes

Dingify uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request.

In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Dingify's servers.
