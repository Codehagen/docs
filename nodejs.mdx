</Info>

## Create a channel

Channels are containers for events. Use one for payments, another for logins, etc.

On the [Dashboard](https://dingify.io/dashboard) you can click create new channel and name it `new-payment`

<Tip>Pro-tip: Keep your channel name simple </Tip>



## Install SDK

To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:

{/* <CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card
    title="Edit Your Docs"
    icon="pen-to-square"
    href="https://mintlify.com/docs/quickstart"
  >
    Get your docs set up locally for easy development
  </Card>
  <Card

    icon="image"
    href="https://mintlify.com/docs/development"

  </Card>
</CardGroup> */}

## 1. Install

Get your Dingify SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```bash pnpm
pnpm i dingify
```

```bash npm
npm i dingify
```

```bash yarn
yarn add dingify
```

</CodeGroup>

## 2. Send your first notification

Get your Dingify SDK.

```typescript page.tsx
import { Dingify } from "dingify";

const dingify = new Dingify({
    apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
});

async function run() {
    const result = await dingify.events.create({
        name: "You got a new payment",
        channel: "new-channel-name",
        icon: "ðŸŽ‰",
        notify: true,
        tags: {
            plan: "premium",
            cycle: "monthly",
        },
    });

    // Handle the result
    console.log(result);
}

```

## Try it yourself

Now that you have everything, you can track your first event. You can do this by making a POST request to the API or by using the SDK.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript cURL
curl -X POST https://api.dingify.workers.dev/api/events \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "x-api-key: <API-KEY>" \
-d '{
  "channel": "new-channel-namex",
  "name": "New-payment",
  "event": "New-payment",
  "user_id": "user-222",
  "icon": "ðŸ¤©",
  "notify": true,
  "tags": {
    "plan": "premium",
    "cycle": "monthly"
  }
}'

```

```typescript Node.js
import { Dingify } from "dingify";

const dingify = new Dingify({
    apiKey: "<YOUR_API_KEY_HERE>",
});

async function run() {
    const result = await dingify.events.create({
        name: "You got a new payment",
        channel: "new-channel-name",
        icon: "ðŸŽ‰",
        notify: true,
        tags: {
            plan: "premium",
            cycle: "monthly",
        },
    });

    // Handle the result
    console.log(result);
}
```

```java Python
Comming soon
```

</CodeGroup>

After making the request you will see the event tracked at Dingify dashboard.
It will be under the channel you created.
